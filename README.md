# Aseprite to Fetch parser
Takes files from asesprite and converts them to binary files used on Fetch

The functions in parser.py are dependent on [py_aseprite](https://github.com/Eiyeron/py_aseprite) from [Eiyeron](https://github.com/Eiyeron). I have added the master brach in its entierty in this repo for simplicity (the repo dose not originaly contain a setup.py file) so all you have to do is go into the folder py_aseprite-master and run
```bash
pip install .
```
or
``` bash
python setup.py instal
```
